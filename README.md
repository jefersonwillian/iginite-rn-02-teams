## Usage

When the app is running, you will be presented with a list of classes that have been added. To create a new class, click the "Add Class" button in the top-right corner of the screen. This will take you to a new screen where you can create a class by entering its name.

After creating a class, you will be redirected to another screen where you can manage its teams. Here you can add people to either Team A or Team B, and delete them if necessary. You can also delete the class by clicking the "Delete Class" button at the bottom of the screen.

To delete a person from a team, simply click the "X" icon next to their name.
